A simple Todo App

This todo app was built on a Microservice Architecture, to enhance scalabiltiy and speed.
The architecture features two services (User and UserTasks)
Powered on the Backend by Lumen (PHP micro-framework that built on Laravelâ€™s top components) and Frontend client built on ReactJs Javascript Library
Each resource is controlled by one controller assigned to it, which in turn has one assigned model and a dedicatedd database- See attached PDF file for block diagram and more.
